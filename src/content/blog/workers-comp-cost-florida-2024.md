Workers' compensation insurance is required for most Florida businesses, but costs vary dramatically by industry. Here's everything you need to know about workers' comp pricing in 2024.

## Average Workers' Comp Costs in Florida

Workers' comp is calculated per $100 of payroll. Here are 2024 average rates by industry:

### Low-Risk Industries

### Example 2: Restaurant (10 employees)

## Factors That Affect Your Workers' Comp Rate

### 1. Industry Classification Code
Your NAIC code determines base rates. Roofers pay more than accountants due to injury risk.

### 2. Claims History (Experience Modification Rate)
- Clean history = lower rates
- Multiple claims = higher rates
- EMR of 1.0 is average
- EMR below 1.0 = discount
- EMR above 1.0 = surcharge

### 3. Payroll Amount
Higher payroll = higher premium (but rate per $100 stays the same).

### 4. Employee Job Duties
Office workers cost less than field workers, even in the same company.

### 5. Safety Programs
Documented safety training can reduce rates by 5-15%.

### 6. Company Size
Larger companies often get better rates due to volume discounts.

## Who Needs Workers' Comp in Florida?

### Required Coverage:
- **Construction:** 1 or more employees (including owners)
- **Non-construction:** 4 or more employees (including owners)
- **Agriculture:** 6 or more regular employees OR 12+ seasonal employees

### Exemptions Available:
- Corporate officers can exempt themselves (with proper documentation)
- Sole proprietors without employees
- Partners in a partnership
- LLC members (with exemption form)

**Important:** Even if exempt, you may need coverage to work with certain clients or on specific job sites.

## How to Lower Your Workers' Comp Costs

### 1. Accurate Job Classifications
Ensure employees are classified correctly. Office staff shouldn't be rated as field workers.

### 2. Implement Safety Programs
- Regular safety training
- Documented safety meetings
- Proper equipment and PPE
- Written safety policies

### 3. Return-to-Work Programs
Getting injured employees back to light duty reduces claim costs.

### 4. Prompt Claim Reporting
Report injuries immediately to prevent small issues from becoming expensive claims.

### 5. Shop Multiple Carriers
Rates vary significantly between insurers. Compare at least 3-5 quotes.

### 6. Pay-As-You-Go Options
Some carriers offer pay-as-you-go based on actual payroll, avoiding large upfront premiums.

### 7. Bundle Policies
Combining workers' comp with general liability can save 10-20%.

### 8. Annual Policy Audits
Ensure your audit is accurate. Overpaying on estimated payroll costs you money.

## Common Workers' Comp Mistakes

### 1. Misclassifying Employees
**Problem:** Classifying roofers as "general labor" to get lower rates.
**Result:** Claims denied, policy canceled, potential fraud charges.

### 2. Not Reporting Payroll Changes
**Problem:** Your payroll increased but you didn't update your policy.
**Result:** Large surprise bill at annual audit.

### 3. Delaying Injury Reports
**Problem:** Waiting days or weeks to report an injury.
**Result:** Higher claim costs, potential claim denial.

### 4. No Safety Documentation
**Problem:** No written safety program or training records.
**Result:** Higher rates, difficulty defending claims.

### 5. Ignoring Experience Mod
**Problem:** Not understanding how claims affect your EMR.
**Result:** Paying higher rates for years after a claim.
