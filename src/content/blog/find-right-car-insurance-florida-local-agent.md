# How to Find the Right Car Insurance in Florida: A Local Agent's Guide

Finding the right car insurance in Florida doesn't have to be complicated. As a local insurance agency, we help Florida drivers every day find coverage that protects them without breaking the bank.

## Why Car Insurance Shopping is Different in Florida

Florida has unique insurance requirements and challenges:
- No-fault PIP system
- High uninsured driver rate (20%)
- Hurricane and weather risks
- Higher-than-average premiums
- Complex coverage options

**That's where we come in.** At PlanLife, we simplify the process and help you find exactly what you need.

## What You Actually Need (Not Just What's Required)

### Florida's Minimum Requirements

**Required by law:**
- $10,000 Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
- $10,000 Property Damage Liability (PDL)

**The problem:** This isn't enough to protect you.

### What We Recommend

**Essential coverage:**
- $10,000 PIP (required)
- $100,000 Property Damage Liability
- $100,000/$300,000 Bodily Injury Liability
- $100,000/$300,000 Uninsured Motorist
- Collision coverage (if car worth over $5,000)
- Comprehensive coverage

**Why:** One serious accident can cost hundreds of thousands. Minimum coverage leaves you exposed.

**Average cost:** $2,400 - $3,200/year (vs $1,200 - $1,800 for minimum)

**Our advice:** The extra $1,000/year is worth the protection.

## How PlanLife Helps You Save Money

### We Compare 50+ Insurance Companies

Instead of getting one quote, we shop dozens of carriers:
- Progressive
- Geico
- Hartford
- Liberty Mutual
- Safeco
- Nationwide
- And 45+ more

**Result:** We find you the best rate for the coverage you need.

### We Find Every Available Discount

**Common discounts we identify:**
- Multi-policy (bundle home + auto): 15-25%
- Good driver: 10-20%
- Good student: 10-25%
- Defensive driving course: 5-10%
- Anti-theft devices: 5-10%
- Low mileage: 5-15%
- Pay-in-full: 5-10%
- Multi-car: 10-25%

**Real example:** Client was paying $3,200/year. We found 6 applicable discounts and reduced premium to $2,100/year—saving $1,100 annually.

### We Right-Size Your Coverage

**Not too much:**
- Don't over-insure old vehicles
- Adjust coverage as car depreciates
- Remove unnecessary add-ons

**Not too little:**
- Adequate liability limits
- Proper uninsured motorist coverage
- Appropriate deductibles

**Just right:** Coverage that protects you without wasting money.

## Understanding Your Car Insurance Options

### Personal Injury Protection (PIP)

**Required:** $10,000 minimum

**Covers:**
- 80% of medical expenses
- 60% of lost wages
- Your injuries (regardless of fault)

**Our tip:** $10,000 is usually adequate since it's no-fault coverage.

### Bodily Injury Liability

**Not required** (but should be!)

**Covers:**
- Injuries to others when you're at fault
- Medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Legal defense

**Our recommendation:** $100,000/$300,000 minimum

**Why:** Protects your assets from lawsuits.

### Property Damage Liability

**Required:** $10,000 minimum

**Covers:**
- Damage to other vehicles
- Damage to property

**Our recommendation:** $100,000

**Why:** Cars are expensive. $10,000 won't cover a new vehicle.

### Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist

**Not required** (but essential!)

**Covers:**
- Your injuries when hit by uninsured driver
- Hit-and-run accidents
- Underinsured driver accidents

**Our recommendation:** Match your bodily injury limits

**Why:** 20% of Florida drivers are uninsured.

### Collision Coverage

**Covers:** Damage to your car in accidents

**When you need it:**
- Car loan or lease (required)
- Car worth over $5,000
- Can't afford to replace car

**Deductible options:** $250, $500, $1,000, $2,500

**Our tip:** $500 deductible balances cost and out-of-pocket expense.

### Comprehensive Coverage

**Covers:**
- Theft
- Vandalism
- Weather damage
- Animal strikes
- Falling objects

**When you need it:**
- Car loan or lease (required)
- Car worth over $3,000
- Live in high-risk area

**Our tip:** Usually inexpensive ($200-500/year), worth having.
