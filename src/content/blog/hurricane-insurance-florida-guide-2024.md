# Hurricane Insurance in Florida: What You Need to Know for 2024

Living in Florida means preparing for hurricane season. Understanding your hurricane insurance coverage is essential for protecting your home and finances.

## Hurricane Insurance Basics

### There's No "Hurricane Insurance" Policy
Hurricane coverage comes from multiple sources:
- **Homeowners insurance** (wind damage)
- **Flood insurance** (water damage)
- **Additional coverage** (specific perils)

### The Coverage Gap Problem
Standard homeowners insurance covers wind damage but NOT flood damage—and hurricanes bring both.

## What Homeowners Insurance Covers

### Wind Damage (Covered)
- Roof damage from high winds
- Broken windows
- Structural damage from wind
- Debris damage
- Fallen trees (from wind)

### Hurricane Deductible Applies
Separate deductible (2-10% of dwelling coverage) triggers when:
- National Weather Service declares hurricane watch/warning
- Named storm affects your area

**Example:** $300,000 home with 5% hurricane deductible = $15,000 out-of-pocket before insurance pays.

## What Homeowners Insurance Doesn't Cover

### Flood Damage (NOT Covered)
- Storm surge
- Rising water
- Ground water seepage
- Sewer backup from flooding

**You need separate flood insurance.**

### Other Exclusions
- Mold (unless from covered peril)
- Landscaping (limited coverage)
- Detached structures (may have limits)
- Vehicles (need auto insurance)

## Flood Insurance Explained

### Two Options:

**1. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)**
- Max $250,000 dwelling coverage
- Max $100,000 contents coverage
- 30-day waiting period
- Standardized rates

**2. Private Flood Insurance**
- Higher coverage limits available
- More coverage options
- Sometimes cheaper than NFIP
- No waiting period (sometimes)

### Who Needs Flood Insurance?

**Required:**
- Mortgage in high-risk flood zone (A or V zones)

**Recommended:**
- Everyone in Florida
- 25% of flood claims come from low-risk areas
- Storm surge can reach miles inland

### Average Flood Insurance Costs
- **High-risk zones:** $2,000 - $8,000/year
- **Moderate-risk zones:** $500 - $2,000/year
- **Low-risk zones:** $400 - $800/year

## Hurricane Deductibles Explained

### How They Work
- Percentage of dwelling coverage (not flat amount)
- Only applies to hurricane/named storm damage
- Separate from regular deductible

### Common Deductible Percentages
- **2%:** Lower out-of-pocket, higher premium
- **5%:** Most common
- **10%:** Higher out-of-pocket, lower premium

### Real-World Examples

**$200,000 Home:**
- 2% deductible = $4,000
- 5% deductible = $10,000
- 10% deductible = $20,000

**$500,000 Home:**
- 2% deductible = $10,000
- 5% deductible = $25,000
- 10% deductible = $50,000

### When Hurricane Deductible Triggers
- Hurricane watch or warning issued
- Tropical storm becomes hurricane
- Named storm affects your area

**Important:** Deductible applies per storm, not per year.

## Hurricane Season Preparation

### Before Hurricane Season (May 1)

**Review Your Coverage:**
- Dwelling coverage adequate?
- Have flood insurance?
- Understand deductibles?
- Know what's covered?

**Document Your Property:**

- Update annually

**Prepare Your Home:**

### During Hurricane Watch/Warning

**Protect Your Property:**

**Gather Important Documents:**

- ID and financial documents
- Medical records
- Pet records

**Prepare Emergency Kit:**

### After the Hurricane

**Safety First:**

## Common Hurricane Claim Issues

### 1. Wind vs. Flood Damage Disputes
**Problem:** Insurer claims damage was flood (not covered) not wind (covered).

**Solution:**
- Hire public adjuster if needed
- Get independent inspection
- Document everything
- Know your policy

### 2. Roof Damage Assessments
**Problem:** Insurer says roof damage was pre-existing.

**Solution:**
- Have pre-storm photos
- Get independent roofer opinion

- Appeal if necessary

### 3. Mold from Water Intrusion
**Problem:** Mold develops after hurricane damage.

**Solution:**
- Document water damage immediately
- Dry out quickly (within 48 hours)
- Mold from covered peril may be covered
- Act fast to prevent mold

### 4. Additional Living Expenses
**Problem:** Home uninhabitable, need hotel.

**Solution:**
- Know your ALE limits
- Keep all receipts
- Stay in reasonable accommodations
- Report to insurer immediately

## How to Lower Hurricane Insurance Costs

### 1. Wind Mitigation Inspection ($75-150)
**Potential savings:** 20-40% on premiums

- Roof-to-wall connections
- Roof deck attachment
- Opening protection

**Discounts for:**
- Hurricane straps/clips
- Impact-resistant windows

### 2. Fortified Roof Certification

**ROI:** 3-5 years typically

### 3. Increase Deductible
**2% to 5%:** Save 15-25%  
**5% to 10%:** Save 20-35%

**Warning:** Ensure you can afford higher deductible.
