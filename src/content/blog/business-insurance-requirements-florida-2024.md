## How to Save on Business Insurance in Florida

### 2. Increase Deductibles
Higher deductibles = lower premiums. Choose what you can afford to pay out-of-pocket.

### 3. Implement Safety Programs
Workers' comp rates drop with documented safety training and low claim history.

### 4. Shop Multiple Carriers
Rates vary significantly. PlanLife compares 50+ carriers to find your best price.

### 5. Pay Annually
Annual payments often include 5-10% discounts compared to monthly payments.

### 6. Maintain Good Credit
Many insurers use credit scores to determine rates.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Underinsuring Your Business
Saving money on premiums isn't worth it if you can't cover a major claim.

### 2. Not Updating Coverage
Review policies annually as your business grows and changes.

### 3. Misclassifying Employees
Incorrect worker classifications can lead to denied claims and penalties.

### 4. Ignoring Cyber Risks
Data breaches are expensive. Don't assume you're too small to be targeted.

### 5. Not Reading Policy Exclusions
Know what's NOT covered before you need to file a claim.
