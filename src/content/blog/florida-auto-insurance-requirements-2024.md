# Florida Auto Insurance Requirements 2024: What You Need to Know

Florida has unique auto insurance requirements that differ from most states. Understanding what coverage you need—and what you should have—can save you money and protect you from financial disaster.

## Florida's Minimum Auto Insurance Requirements
