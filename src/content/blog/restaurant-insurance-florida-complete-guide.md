- Separate policy through NFIP or private insurers

### Health Department Requirements
- Maintain proper insurance for licensing
- Proof of coverage required for permits
- Minimum liability limits vary by county

## Restaurant Insurance Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Underinsuring Property
**Problem:** Equipment costs more to replace than you think.
**Solution:** Get replacement cost coverage, not actual cash value.

### 2. Skipping Liquor Liability
**Problem:** "We only serve beer and wine."
**Reality:** Still need coverage—claims can be massive.

### 3. Not Updating Coverage
**Problem:** Business grew but insurance didn't.
**Solution:** Review coverage annually as revenue increases.

### 4. Misclassifying Employees
**Problem:** Listing cooks as "clerical" for lower workers' comp rates.
**Result:** Denied claims, policy cancellation, fraud charges.

### 5. No Business Interruption Coverage
**Problem:** Fire closes restaurant for 3 months.
**Result:** No income but still paying rent, loans, and salaries.
