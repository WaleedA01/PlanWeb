## Common Small Business Insurance Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Waiting Until You Need It

**Problem:** Insurance doesn't cover incidents before your policy starts.

**Solution:** Get coverage before you open your doors.

**PlanLife helps:** We make the process quick and easy, so you're protected from day one.

### Mistake #2: Buying Minimum Coverage to Save Money

**Problem:** $300,000 won't cover a serious claim.

**Solution:** Get adequate coverage (minimum $1M for most businesses).

**PlanLife helps:** We explain what you actually need and why, so you can make informed decisions.

### Mistake #3: Not Reading the Policy

**Problem:** Surprised by exclusions when filing a claim.

**Solution:** Understand what's covered and what's not.

**PlanLife helps:** We explain your policy in plain English, no insurance jargon.

### Mistake #4: Not Updating Coverage as You Grow

**Problem:** Business doubles in size, insurance stays the same.

**Solution:** Annual policy reviews.

**PlanLife helps:** We proactively review your coverage every year at no extra cost.

### Mistake #5: Choosing Based on Price Alone

**Problem:** Cheapest policy often has inadequate coverage.

**Solution:** Compare coverage details, not just price.

**PlanLife helps:** We present multiple options with clear explanations of differences.
